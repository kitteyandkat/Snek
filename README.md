# Gameplay Instructions 
You are a very hungry Snake! In order to play, use the arrow keys to guide yourself to some yummy treats! As the you eat the treats, you grow larger. While the treats are delicious your tail is no! Try to eat as many treats, while avoiding the walls, and eating your own tail.
