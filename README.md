# Gameplay Instructions 
You are a very hungry Snake! In order to play, use the arrow keys to guide yourself to some yummy treats! As the you eat the treats, you gain energy which causes you to grow larger and slither faster! While the treats are delicious your tail is not! Try to eat as many treats as you can, all while avoiding the walls, and eating your own tail!

# Special Thanks
A significant portion of this project involved Three.js, which is a library that I had zero experience prior to this project. The 3D portion of this project would not have been possible without the comprehensive Three.js tutorials by <a href='https://twitter.com/iced_coffee_dev'> Simon Dev</a>, which can be found on his <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@simondev758'> YouTube</a>. Additionally, when there was a concept that I did not fully understand, my brother <a href ='http://officialjabe.info'> Abe Johnson </a> explained it in plain language for me. Not least of all, my incredible instructors <a href ='https://www.brandongottshall.com'> Brandon Gottshall</a> and <a href= 'https://www.devonselvaggi.com'> Devon Selvaggi</a> at <a href= 'https://www.nebulaacademy.com'> Nebula Academy</a>  have given me the knowledge and tools to develop this game using vanillaJS, CSS and HTML. 

Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
